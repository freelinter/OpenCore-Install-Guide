# Saying goodbye

::: details A little details on what I'm doing
As you guys know, I'm feeling horribly bad lately, and I don't feel comfortable being on Discord and using technology for too long. This time, I've decided to refresh myself, with the main stuff being:

* Going outside more often
* Stop using Discord or use a new account.

I'll still hang out but with a new persona in:

* /r/Hackintosh Paradise (Formerly CorpNewtonians Paradise)
* SMG4's Hobo Paradise (Maybe)

For the rest, I'm not sure.

Still in WIP, please wait.
