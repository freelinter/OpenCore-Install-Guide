# Saying goodbye

::: details A little details on what I'm doing
As you guys know, I'm feeling horribly bad lately, and I don't feel comfortable being on Discord and using technology for too long. This time, I've decided to refresh myself, with the main stuff being:

* Going outside more often
* Stop using Discord or use a new account.

I'll still hang out but with a new persona in:

* /r/Hackintosh Paradise (Formerly CorpNewtonians Paradise)
* SMG4's Hobo Paradise (Maybe)
* MineTurtlee's Hideout
* HelioHost
* Capyhub
* Rythm (tho it's dead)

For the rest, I'm not sure.
Please, don't try to harrass me to come back or something. I have not quitted yet.
My old account and alts will still be available for DMs, GDMs and pings.
I hope y'all have a good time, my friends! 

**A bit more info about my new account**

You will not be able to know the username, but it should be one of my last usernames, which you **may** or **may not** recognize.
The hints are:

* **Mine**Turtlee
* What is the explosive mob in Minecraft?
* What sound does the ^ make when it explodes?
* The bomb game
* Human form of Freelinter (you know him)

Some are correct, and some are not. Have fun!!

Please read the details box before even trying to pull me back or something. This is one of the decisions I've been struggling to make so far in life. It might, or might not be final.
Count this as a farewell letter.
Kind regards,
__****MineTurtlee.****__
